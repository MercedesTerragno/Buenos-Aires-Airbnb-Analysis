## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Airbnb is an online platform that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. Setting the right price can be challenging for new hosts, and it's fundamental to find the sweet spot between occupancy and price. 

Buenos Aires Airbnb data from February 2021 was used to answer the following three questions:

- Is it worth it to be a superhost and/or being verified?
- What are the prices in different neighbourhoods?
- What attributes of a listing correlate with price?

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings can be found at the post available [here](https://mercedesterragno.medium.com/hosting-in-buenos-aires-how-should-you-set-your-price-bd2eeef59631).
